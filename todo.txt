Only do reduction of best results across agents groups, not across the trials.  After getting the
best result for each agent group, take the average over all the trials.

improve number of threads per block for calc_quality kernel

Setup competition to only compete against a certain number of others, such as 8, 16, or 32.  Then the winner of each group will have their fitness calc'd to see if they are the new best.  Sharing of the new best will be the same as current.


Create visual learning tool to see the learning level of all the agents as they progress.
Show agents dieing, being cloned, etc.  Possibly add sliders for changing the learning parameters
for alpha, test-interval, add more agents

Investigate why fitness values change slightly.  Is Rand... function being called from some testing routing?

Reduce register usage



Have 2 different share_best_pct, one for when a new agent becomes the best and one for every other time.  Could then do away with the --SHARE_ALWAYS flag.


---->>>>> check for restart within the learning kernel, don't do it in the CPU
only break out of learning to do testing
